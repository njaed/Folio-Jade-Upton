        From the moment I caught sight of Mumbai from the plane window, I began
        my journey of what would be two weeks of never-ending culture shock.
        Expecting the iconic city of vibrant colour I was told so frequently
        stories of, I was instead met by a sleeping city cloaked beneath a
        smothering blanket of grey smog. I sat with my mouth ajar in disbelief
        that the dystopian artistic depictions of irreversible climate change
        I’ve been fed so frequently by liberal Australian media was suddenly so
        real and right in front of me. This continued on the bus ride from the
        airport to the hotel as we chaotically drove past informal settlements
        held together by tarps and scrap metal, rivers saturated with more
        rubbish than there was water, and structures that I couldn’t tell were
        being built or demolished. I couldn’t help but find symbolism in these
        observations that mirrored the state of India’s political leadership and
        its apparent ignorance towards sustainable development; legendary beauty
        being its sacrifice. However within the first week, I realised that I
        had no real knowledge or right to make such an ignorant assumption, and
        that Mumbai’s beauty dances alive, rich and complex in its unique chaos.

        During our first day at TISS we learnt about India’s experience of
        British colonisation, a piece of history I knew of vaguely but did not
        realise how significant of an effect it had on India’s present day. I
        assumed that because India’s indigenous population gained back
        sovereignty and independence from British rule, they do not face the
        same present day ramifications as Australia’s Aboriginal population who
        still face great systematic injustices as a result of colonisation
        progressing to the extent it has today; and are ultimately still
        deprived of their rightful sovereignty. This assumption was wildly
        incorrect to say the least. Indeed, Britain had horrifically “removed
        India from its position of the world’s manufacturing powerhouse to a
        symbol of poverty and famine” during the mid-nineteenth and twentieth
        centuries (Tanya Koshy, 2022). And certainly, the immense economic and
        social repercussions resultant from the injustices of colonialism are
        still visible today- though of course India and Australia’s experience
        of post-colonialism differs incredibly based on their unique history.

        What really imprinted the reality of these repercussive social issues
        upon me were the conjunctive experiences outside of the classroom. At
        TISS we learnt thoroughly about the ways in which current social issues
        such as gender inequality and mass urbanisation plays an important and
        greatly overlooked factor in the climate change crisis. Gaining this
        knowledge and then walking the streets of Mumbai and talking to locals
        put this knowledge into the perspective of the individual experience;
        opposed to being fed statistics and generalised experiences, I could
        hear the different lived perspectives of these social issues and create
        an understanding based upon how locals perceive these issues. I found
        this to be far more valuable than a judgement based upon my own
        understanding of morality with regards to this complex intersection, as
        it made me understand that the ethics and morality of problem solving
        must always be dependent upon the views and ways of living of a local
        population (Partha Mukhopadhyay and Aromar Revi, 2011) .

        Particularly, visiting the home-grown neighbourhood of Dharavi
        illuminated how empowering and listening to local voices is the most
        ethical and effective way to assist in the ratification of the issues
        they face. At Dharavi I learnt that the inhabitants of Dharavi are proud
        of their work, where they live, and of their community. They do not want
        the operations of their community to change. Paired with this
        experience, I learnt from TISS that informal settlements such as Dharavi
        are incredibly efficient in generating economy with minimal effects upon
        the environment compared to other factory based industries. The problem
        is not necessarily the existence of informal settlements but rather the
        lack of occupational health and safety policies that ensures safe
        working conditions. Hence, according to the people who I spoke to in
        Dharavi, the government must prioritise including local voices in
        “mitigation” and “adaption” initiatives (Azman Usmani, 2022). Currently,
        it is common that marginalised demographics populate informal
        settlements and are subject to government action that is ignorant of
        their way of living, and forces them to assimilate to new ways of living
        that are not suited to their lifestyles and ways of generating income,
        ultimately further disempowering them (Madhushree Sekher, 2022).

        Over week one we learnt in great detail the different perspectives that
        are available to view climate change within the context of Mumbai and
        India in general. Throughout week two, we started shifting this focus to
        the practicalities of actualising solutions to remedy both climate
        change and the social issues that exacerbate its potency among our
        allocated groups.

        My group and I realised that we had different focuses that we would like
        to pursue from what we had learnt over the week- mine personally being
        exploring the positive effect empowering local voices has upon the
        experience of climate change within rural villages. What I tried my best
        to do in workshops was facilitate conversations that allowed everyone to
        express their passions which would enabled us to find an issue that
        incorporated all of our interests. By establishing our three main
        priorities (Climate Action, Quality Education and, Reduced Inequalities)
        together as a group, we realised that the issue of climate induced
        vulnerability within minority communities combined a lot of our passions
        and permitted us to pursue our various areas of interest.

        However, these differences did not end here. A debate developed
        regarding how we should frame the issue to best depict the issue. This
        concerned how we should address marginalised communities, particularly
        women, without the threat of generalisation; a fear instilled into me by
        Rebecca Pearse’s “Gender and Climate Change”. Pearse stresses that
        “gendered vulnerability to climate change is not due to characteristics
        intrinsic to women as a group”, but rather it is “the social
        organisation of women’s reproductive and productive labor in different
        socioeconomic and cultural circumstances shapes the immediate ‘factors’
        associated with women’s higher risks and climate change-related burdens”
        (Pearse, 2017) . It was the first time I had actually ever encountered
        significant disagreement in a team project, and so opted to follow the
        advice of “The Secrets of Great Teamwork” by Martine Haas and Mark
        Mortensen; that structuring norms for discussion can help greatly in
        making it efficient and effective (Haas and Mortsen, 2016). Unlike the
        hour long discussion of the topic online, where no compromise was even
        remotely reached, by setting up a time and place to meet and talk in
        person we were able to straighten out our differences within a matter of
        minutes. We realised that we were all basically on the same view of how
        to frame the issue, but just communicated this view differently. From
        this point, rehearsing and presenting our presentation went well as we
        became able to rely on a bond that lasted through some form of hardship.

        Week two was also the most bittersweet time for us as a cohort. Knowing
        that we were all soon going to return to a time where the spontaneous
        adventures aren’t as easily ready for us was of course sad. Throughout
        the past two weeks I consciously made the effort to challenge my social
        anxiety. I used the opportunity I had of being surrounded by peers with
        the same interests and attitude towards social justice to make amazing
        memories in an equally amazing city with equally amazing people. Now I
        have gained life long friendships and memories that I will treasure
        forever, and am forever bound to Mumbai with a hunger for more.

        Before I left for India I pictured that my first entry would illustrate
        India’s iconic beauty; idolising the way India’s radiant sun warms the
        streets at dawn and gently brings to life its vivid colours like a
        blooming daffodil. Now as I am writing this, a week since my return, I
        believe that my view of my GIG experience has become somewhat more
        nuanced- though I’m sure it will be subject to change throughout the
        rest of my life. The people of Mumbai have shown me that the city’s
        beauty, though outwardly subdued and its colours dulled slightly, is as
        bright as ever and indeed, is kept alive by the spirits of its populous.
        The people I met in Mumbai have been the most generous and kind people I
        have possibly ever met. But more than this, they are simultaneously also
        the most fierce and resilient people I have possibly ever met.
        Truthfully the requirements for this conclusion are also impossible to
        condense into 200 words. But with everything I’ve learnt and
        accomplished, the same lesson recurs: "keep exploring”. Keep exploring
        your realm of understanding, the corners of a city and its millions of
        menus, friendships, the limits of your comfort zone; there is so much to
        gain from exploration focused mindset and I hope that I continue to make
        an effort to always be exploring.
